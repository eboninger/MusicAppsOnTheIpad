#Assumptions#
* You have programming experience with C and C++
* Knowing Java is helpful too

#Overview#
* Object-Oriented Programming Language
* Circa 1980
* Originated at NeXT which was bought out by Apple
* Ideally used for interchangable software components
* Based on Smalltalk
* Strict superset of C; any Obj-C compiler can compile a C program
* Based on "message passing".  That is, you do not call a function but you send a message!
* In iOS, the LLVM Clang (clang) compiler is used, not gcc

#The Usual Gang#
* Comments
* cAsE sEnSiTiVe
* Operations and operands
* Most data types
* `for`, `while`, `if`
* Pointer variables
* Preprocessors
  * It goes without saying `iostream` is not used!
* Format strings
* Inheritance and overriding methods

#Method (or Function) Declaration#
    - (void) setNumerator: (int) n
    ^ method type. "-" = instance method, "+" = class method (performs some operation on the class itself)
      ^^^^^^ return type
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^ method name
                         ^ method takes argument
                           ^^^^ argument type
                                 ^ argument name

#Interface Declaration (.h file)#
    @interface NEWCLASSNAME : PARENTCLASSNAME
      // Properties and method declarations
    @end

#Implementation Declaration (.m file)#
    @implementation NEWCLASSNAME
      // Method declarations here
    @end

* Dot syntax (Objective-C 2.0; should be only used for getters and setters)

#Keyword Changes, C++ to Objective-C#
* `NULL` => `nil`
* `this` => `self`
* `new` => `alloc` (but does NOT call constructor)
* `delete` => `release`

#New (or Differences)#
* The `id` type => used to store an object of any type
* All instance variables are private in Objective-C by default
* `@""` => NSString object, without the `@` in a string => C style string
* Memory management
* Constructor => `init`
* Destructor => `dealloc`
* Accessors (better known as "properties")
  * Read http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/cocoa/conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/EncapsulatingData/EncapsulatingData.html
  * Good read: "What clang taught us about Objective-C properties" http://www.crashlytics.com/blog/what-clang-taught-us-about-objective-c-properties/
* Protocols

* Categories

#Hiccups#
* Cannot overload functions; must use a different name
* Cannot use parameter names that are same as instance variable names
* Cannot make a member function private

#The Foundation Framework#
* `#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>`
* Collection of classes, methods, functions, and documentation logically grouped together
* Many basic objects
* `NSObject`
* `NSString vs. NSMutableString`
* `NSSNumber`
* `NSInteger`
* `NSLog`
* `NSArray`
* `NSMutableArray`
* `NSDictionary`

#Exercises#
1. Convert the C++ project in `cpp_to_objc/MyRectCpp` as best as you can to Objective-C
