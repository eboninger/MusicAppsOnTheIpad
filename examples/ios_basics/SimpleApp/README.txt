This app demonstrates:
1. Using basic widgets (e.g., buttons, sliders, labels)
2. Using Interface Builder (IB) to create a view
3. Event handling via linking a widget to an IBAction method in a view controller
4. Using IBOutlets
5. The power of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern (i.e., one iPhone view and one iPad view)

This app was developed and tested on Xcode 4.6
