* The instructors
* What this course is
* What this course is NOT
* Expectations and assessment
* App demos, previous works
* What makes a good music app?
  - Easy entry: the app presents itself in an informative and appealing way. A good intro screen that uses words and graphics to tell the user what he/she is getting.
  - Usefulness: the app does something the user wants or needs to do
  - Depth: as the user gets to know it, there are more layers and features to explore
  - Transparency: the user can find his/her way around easily, features and settings aren't obscure
  - Documentation: well-written, well-organized help screens outlining every feature concisely but completely
  - Good sound: the sounds are attractive, not boring (no 8-bit!)
  - Expandability: other features and/or sounds can be brought into the app, either free or in-app purchase
* The first project; teams TBD (everything is done in teams in this course)
