<h1>Music Apps on the iPad</h1>
<h2>COMP 150-ISW, Tufts University Department of Computer Science, Spring 2015</h2>
</div>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>This course emphasizes developing apps for musicians on the iPad.  The course will culminate in a project where students demonstrate their abilities through developing production-ready apps in small teams.  The class will start with the iOS SDK.  Music theory and music notation will also be emphasized early in the course.  Students will learn how to access microphone data and low-level audio features, render 2D drawings and graphics, handle gestures, use networking, and perform concurrency properly.</p>
